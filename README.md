> Introducing A-EYE, An AI screen that analyzes customers' appearence, age and gender to enable stores in a mall to display targeted advertisements. In this setup, a camera analyzes facial features to determine which advertisements should be shown, and then those advertisements are displayed on a screen, This process is regularly repeated within a predefined timeframe. Stores will request these advertisements to admin on a website in order to be approved and then displayed on the screen, and they will be updated there on a regular basis. In addition, AI may assist store owners in developing promotional strategies for a certain time frame.

>  Our project is driven by the mission to innovate advertising in malls by providing precise targeting through cutting-edge facial recognition technology. By analyzing the faces of individuals in the mall, we aim to deliver targeted and relevant advertisements, creating a more personalized and engaging shopping experience.

> We designed A-Eye website using wireframes and mockups, iterating on the design until we reached the ideal layout for easy navigation and a seamless user experience.

<!-- Tech stack -->

###  A-Eye is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
  - ðŸš¨ Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve!
- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
